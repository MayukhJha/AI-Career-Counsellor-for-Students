# 🎓 AI Career Counsellor for Students

**AI Career Counsellor for Students** is a web-based application built to help students explore career options based on their interests, strengths, and preferences. It simulates the role of a human counsellor by guiding users through a simple quiz and offering tailored career suggestions.

> This project was created to demonstrate how front-end technologies can be used to build interactive educational tools that add real value to students' lives.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Student visits the website** and clicks "Start Quiz."  
2. **Answers a series of questions** about interests, academic preferences, and hobbies.  
3. Based on input, a **career suggestion is displayed** with a brief description.  
4. Optionally, users can **retake the quiz** to explore more options.

> Currently, all logic is handled on the frontend with no external data source. Suggestions are hardcoded but logically mapped.
