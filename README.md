🎓 AI Career Counsellor for Students
AI Career Counsellor for Students is a web-based application built to help students explore career options based on their interests, strengths, and preferences. It simulates the role of a human counsellor by guiding users through a simple quiz and offering tailored career suggestions.

This project was created to demonstrate how front-end technologies can be used to build interactive educational tools that add real value to students' lives.

🧠 How It Works
Student visits the website and clicks "Start Quiz."

Answers a series of questions about interests, academic preferences, and hobbies.

Based on input, a career suggestion is displayed with a brief description.

Optionally, users can retake the quiz to explore more options.

Currently, all logic is handled on the frontend with no external data source. Suggestions are hardcoded but logically mapped.
